# Population_Genetics_and_Genomics
Materials for the ACE - Uganda course "Population Genetics &amp; Genomics" given in Spring 2020.  Hello! This repository will contain materials related to lectures presented as part of the BReCA program of Makere University in Kampala, Uganda during the Spring semester 2020. Since this is a public repository the materials stored here will be lecture slides, small data sets, and possibly scripts or one-liners to be used for running analyses in lecture demos.
